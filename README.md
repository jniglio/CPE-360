This is our final version of the project for the Robot Car. This was completed during my first year at Stevens Institute of Technology.

This projectâ€™s objective was to code a robot using a WeMos R1 board to hit a series of
targets with an arena. Requirements were given for the team to meet regarding the mechanical
properties of the robot and the manner in which the robot completes the course within the
arena. The team utilized a system of trial and error to determine the best way for the robot to
accomplish the task. The code for the robot utilized a state machine in order to instruct the robot
to complete specific tasks in the specified order in a way that was organized for both the robot
and a reader of the code. After a month of trials and readjusting code, the team completed the
course on the first attempt on the day of the final competition with a time of thirty-seven
seconds. The process used by the team proved to be effective and resulted in a successful run
receiving full credit.
